    Differing types of automated mechanisms can meet the intent of IR-6(1) This mechanism
may be a web-based form that is populated by the ISSM/ISSO or SA alerting the
appropriate individuals, or an email process that includes a preset distribution group to
ensure all key individuals are alerted in the event of an incident, e.g., ISSM/ISSO,
GSSO/CPSO, PSO/Director of Security, Incident Response lead (e.g., SAPCOâ€™s IA
POC), DAO, and AO. Where a web-based form or email distribution is used, the
responder should be cautious of the type of incident and the classification of information
in the incident description and the classification of the system being used.
