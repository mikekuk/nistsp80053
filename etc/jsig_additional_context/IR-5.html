    Collecting user statements of those involved in incidents with SAP information systems is
also required in order to completely document the details of an incident.

While it is not cost effective for most organizations to maintain an online incident
management system, there are functions that can be automated to support the incident
handling process. For instance mechanisms in support of identification or detection and
analysis include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>System audit logs that capture unsuccessful attempts to log into the system, attempts
        to gain access to unauthorized folders/files, attempts to introduce unauthorized
        software or media.</li>
    <li>
        Device audit logs.
    </li>
    <li>
        IDS, content filtering applications, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
