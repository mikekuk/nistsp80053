<p>Individuals involved in incident response, reporting and handling will treat each incident as a
	potentially criminal case. IA professionals not trained in forensics and investigation should
	ensure preservation of the scene and contact their IA forensics point of contact (POC) prior
	to moving from the containment phase to the eradication phase to ensure preservation of data
	(both volatile and nonvolatile) required for criminal prosecution. The NIST version of the
	incident response lifecycle is depicted in Figure 3-1 in <a href="https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/91/Documents/CTP/NAO/JSIG_2016April11_Final_(53Rev4).pdf"> Implmentation Guide </a> and described in NIST SP 800-61.
</p>
<p>Incidents are identified using the categories below, as indicated in CJSCM 6510.01B, Cyber
	Incident handling Program, Table B-A-2.
	In addition to selecting the appropriate category, also indicate if the incident resulted in a
	data spill and/or unauthorized disclosure.

        <th>Category</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1 Root Level Intrusion (Incident)</td>
        <td>Unauthorized privileged access to an IS.
Privileged access, often referred to as administrative or root access, provides
unrestricted access to the IS. This category includes unauthorized access to
information or unauthorized access to account credentials that could be used to
perform administrative functions (e.g., domain administrator). If the IS
compromised with malicious code that provides remote interactive control, it
will be reported in this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2 User Level Intrusion (Incident)</td>
        <td>Unauthorized non-privileged access to an IS.
Non-privileged access, often referred to as user-level access, provides restricted
access to the IS based on the privileges granted to the user. This includes
unauthorized access to information or unauthorized access to account credentials
that could be used to perform user functions such as accessing Web applications,
Web portals, or other similar information resources. If the IS is compromised
with malicious code that provides remote interactive control, it will be reported
in this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3 Unsuccessful Activity Attempt (Event)</td>
        <td>Deliberate attempts to gain unauthorized access to an IS that are defeated by normal defensive mechanisms.
Attacker fails to gain access to the IS (i.e., attacker attempts valid or potentially
valid username and password combinations) and the activity cannot be
characterized as exploratory scanning. Reporting of these events is critical for
the gathering of useful effects-based metrics for commanders.
Note: the above CAT 3 explanation does not cover the "run-of-the-mill" virus
that is defeated/deleted by AV software. "Run-of-the-mill" viruses that are
defeated/deleted by AV software are not reportable events or incidents and
should not be annotated in JIMS.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4 Denial of Service (Incident)</td>
        <td>Activity that denies, degrades, or disrupts normal functionality of an IS or DoD information network.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5 Non-Compliance Activity (Event)</td>
        <td>Activity that potentially exposes IS to increased risk as a result of the action or inaction of authorized users. This
includes administrative and user actions such as failure to apply security patches,
connections across security domains, installation of vulnerable applications, and
other breaches of existing DOD policy. Reporting of these events is critical for
the gathering of useful effects-based metrics for commanders.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6 Reconnaissance (Event)</td>
        <td>Activity that seeks to gather information used to characterize IS, applications, networks, and users that may be useful in
formulating an attack. This includes activity such as mapping DOD networks, IS
devices and applications, interconnectivity, and their users or reporting structure.
This activity does not directly result in a compromise.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>7 Malicious Logic (Incident)</td>
        <td>Installation of software designed and/or deployed by adversaries with malicious intentions for the purpose of gaining access
to resources or information without the consent or knowledge of the user. This
only includes malicious code that does not provide remote interactive control of
the compromised IS. Malicious code that has allowed interactive access should
be categorized as Category 1 or Category 2 incidents, not Category 7.
Interactive active access may include automated tools that establish an open
channel of communications to and/or from an IS.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>8 Investigating (Event)</td>
        <td>Events that are potentially malicious or anomalous activity deemed suspicious and warrant, or are undergoing, further review.
No event will be closed out as a Category 8. Category 8 will be re-categorized to
appropriate Category 1-7 or 9 prior to closure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>9 Explained Anomaly (Event)</td>
        <td>Suspicious events that after further investigation are determined to be non-malicious activity and do not fit the criteria for any
other categories. This includes events such as IS malfunctions and false alarms.
When reporting these events, the reason for which it cannot be otherwise
categorized must be clearly specified.</td>

	The terms used above aid in tracking trends. In rare instances when an incident may need to
be reported (reference IR-6) outside of the DoD SAP Community, the CA SAPCO and AO
will determine the appropriate category and channel for reporting. CA SAPCOs, for
instance, may use a specific reporting process and terms to better address incidents in their
community. An Incident or Reportable Event Category is a collection of events or incidents
sharing a common underlying cause for which an incident or event is reported. Each event or
incident is associated with one or more categories as part of the incident handling process.
</p>
<p>
Event 5 Sub-categories:
<ul>
<li>a. Unmarked IS Components - Unmarked IS components or media that place classified data
at risk.
<li>b. Unattended IS Components - Discovery of unlocked active session without user present.</li>
<li>c. Unauthorized Software (not malicious) - Software obtained through unofficial channels
and installed without proper approval.</li>
<li>d. Other ________</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Event 6 Sub-category:
<ul>
	<li>
Unauthorized Monitoring - Any monitoring of an IS without written approval from legal or
security authorities.
