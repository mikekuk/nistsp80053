    Service/Agency SAPCOs should identify an entity to provide Computer Network
Defense (CND). PSOs and field reps would then report all incidents to the CND Service
Provider (CNDSP) for analysis and response determination, providing guidance to the
site as needed. This provides an organization-wide awareness of incidents, a broader
capability for identifying trends, and the potential to share information with other
organizations in the community.
