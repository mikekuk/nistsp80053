    In the case of a suspected incident, containment procedures must begin immediately.
However, PSO/GSSO/CPSO confirmation of the classification of the information spilled is
required promptly so decisions concerning scale of containment and eradication efforts can
be scoped, e.g., SAP data spilled onto another SAP system tends to be (although not always)
less critical than SAP data spilled to an unclassified system.

<p>
    The ISSM/ISSO is responsible for reporting incidents to security as well as to the AO, e.g.,
the ISSM/ISSO reports to the GSSO/CPSO, who in turn reports to the PSO and the PSO to
the Director of Security and/or CA SAPCO. The ISSM/ISSO must also report the incident to
the system DAO who in turn reports it to the AO and/or CA SAPCO. [IR-6.b] If an activity
from another organization is involved, the PSO or Director of Security will provide proper
notification to the organization.
</p>
<p>
    Incidents in progress are classified a minimum of UNCLASSIFIED//Handle via Special
Access Channels Only (U//HVSACO). The PSO should be notified via secure
communications as soon as an incident has occurred or is in progress. Initial/interim
reporting should begin as soon as possible after knowledge of the incident and should
continue until the incident is resolved.
</p>
<p>
    Organizations will continue to report until the incident is closed. The CA SAPCO, Director
of Security, and AO will determine follow-on actions.
</p>
<p>
    Information system-related fraud, waste, and abuse issues should be reported to the PSO,
ISO and/or ISSM/ISSO and dealt with by the organizationâ€™s chain of command. Individuals
also have the right to call the Fraud, Waste and Abuse Center (FWAC) hotline.
