General users must also know to whom and when to report suspicious activity and to keep discussions about potential incidents within the incident response chain of command.</p> <p>Privileged users should be trained in preserving the scene, preserving the data (volatile and nonvolatile), chain of custody, and reporting requirements. Privileged users frequently move from the containment phase to eradication compromising data necessary in prosecuting a potentially criminal case. Privileged users must also know who to contact for assistance in responding to an incident, e.g., the organizations IA point of contact. Additional incident response related training may be required depending on the system, environment, and mission criticality.</p>",
