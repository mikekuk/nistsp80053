            <p>Central management refers to the organization-wide management and implementation of selected security controls and related processes. Central management includes planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed security controls and processes. As central management of security controls is generally associated with common controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of security control implementations and management and judicious use of organizational resources.  Centrally-managed security controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate as part of organizational continuous monitoring. As part of the security control selection process, organizations determine which controls may be suitable for central management based on organizational resources and capabilities. Organizations consider that it may not always be possible to centrally manage every aspect of a security control. In such cases, the security control is treated as a hybrid control with the control managed and implemented either centrally or at the information system level. Controls and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management include, but are not limited to: AC-2(1) (2) (3) (4); AC-17(1) (2) (3) (9); AC-18(1) (3) (4) (5); AC-19(4); AC-22; AC-23; AT-2(1) (2); AT-3(1) (2) (3); AT-4; AU-6(1) (3) (5) (6) (9); AU-7(1) (2); AU-11, AU-13, AU-16, CA-2(1) (2) (3); CA-3(1) (2) (3); CA-7(1); CA-9; CM-2(1) (2); CM-3(1) (4); CM-4; CM-6(1); CM-7(4) (5); CM-8 (all); CM-9(1); CM-10; CM-11; CP-7 (all); CP-8 (all); SC-43; SI-2; SI-3; SI-7; and SI-8.</p>
