                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The organization manages information system authenticators by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>IA-5a.</strong> Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5b.</strong> Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5c.</strong> Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5d.</strong> Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5e.</strong> Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5f.</strong> Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5g.</strong> Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by authenticator type];
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5h.</strong> Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5i.</strong> Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect authenticators; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5j.</strong> Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.
</li>
</ol>

            <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IA-5 (1) - PASSWORD-BASED AUTHENTICATION</strong> <p><p>The information system, for password-based authentication:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (1)(a)</strong> Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type];
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (1)(b)</strong> Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are created: [Assignment: organization-defined number];
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (1)(c)</strong> Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (1)(d)</strong> Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum];
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (1)(e)</strong> Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number] generations; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (1)(f)</strong> Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (2) - PKI-BASED AUTHENTICATION</strong> <p><p>The information system, for PKI-based authentication:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (2)(a)</strong> Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status information;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (2)(b)</strong> Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (2)(c)</strong> Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>IA-5 (2)(d)</strong> Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the network.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (3) - IN-PERSON OR TRUSTED THIRD-PARTY REGISTRATION</strong> <p><p>The organization requires that the registration process to receive [Assignment: organization-defined types of and/or specific authenticators] be conducted [Selection: in person; by a trusted third party] before [Assignment: organization-defined registration authority] with authorization by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (4) - AUTOMATED SUPPORT  FOR PASSWORD STRENGTH DETERMINATION</strong> <p><p>The organization employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently strong to satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (5) - CHANGE AUTHENTICATORS PRIOR TO DELIVERY</strong> <p><p>The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (6) - PROTECTION OF AUTHENTICATORS</strong> <p><p>The organization protects authenticators commensurate with the security category of the information to which use of the authenticator permits access.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (7) - NO EMBEDDED UNENCRYPTED STATIC AUTHENTICATORS</strong> <p><p>The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or access scripts or stored on function keys.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (8) - MULTIPLE INFORMATION SYSTEM ACCOUNTS</strong> <p><p>The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple information systems.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (9) - CROSS-ORGANIZATION CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT</strong> <p><p>The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for cross-organization management of credentials.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (10) - DYNAMIC CREDENTIAL ASSOCIATION</strong> <p><p>The information system dynamically provisions identities.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (11) - HARDWARE TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION</strong> <p><p>The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined token quality requirements].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (12) - BIOMETRIC-BASED AUTHENTICATION</strong> <p><p>The information system, for biometric-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined biometric quality requirements].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (13) - EXPIRATION OF CACHED AUTHENTICATORS</strong> <p><p>The information system prohibits the use of cached authenticators after [Assignment: organization-defined time period].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (14) - MANAGING CONTENT OF PKI TRUST STORES</strong> <p><p>The organization, for PKI-based authentication, employs a deliberate organization-wide methodology for managing the content of PKI trust stores installed across all platforms including networks, operating systems, browsers, and applications.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>IA-5 (15) - FICAM-APPROVED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</strong> <p><p>The organization uses only FICAM-approved path discovery and validation products and services.</p>
