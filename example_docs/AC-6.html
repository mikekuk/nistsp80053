                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The organization employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>AC-6 (1) - AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO SECURITY FUNCTIONS</strong> <p><p>The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6 (2) - NON-PRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR NONSECURITY FUNCTIONS</strong> <p><p>The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information], use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6 (3) - NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS</strong> <p><p>The organization authorizes network access to [Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands] only for [Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs] and documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6 (4) - SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINS</strong> <p><p>The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6 (5) - PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS</strong> <p><p>The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6 (6) - PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS</strong> <p><p>The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by non-organizational users.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6 (7) - REVIEW OF USER PRIVILEGES</strong> <p><p>The organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>AC-6 (7)(a)</strong> Reviews [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the privileges assigned to [Assignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users] to validate the need for such privileges; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>AC-6 (7)(b)</strong> Reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission/business needs.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6 (8) - PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR CODE EXECUTION</strong> <p><p>The information system prevents [Assignment: organization-defined software] from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6 (9) - AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS</strong> <p><p>The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6 (10) - PROHIBIT NON-PRIVILEGED USERS FROM EXECUTING PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS</strong> <p><p>The information system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.</p>
