                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The organization employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.</p>

            </div>
            
            
            
        <div class="section" id="guidance">
            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>AC-6(1) - AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO SECURITY FUNCTIONS</strong> <p><p>The organization explicitly authorizes access to <span class="option" id="AC-6(1)_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information]</span>.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6(2) - NON-PRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR NONSECURITY FUNCTIONS</strong> <p><p>The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to <span class="option" id="AC-6(2)_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information]</span>, use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6(3) - NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS</strong> <p><p>The organization authorizes network access to <span class="option" id="AC-6(3)_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands]</span> only for <span class="option" id="AC-6(3)_Option2"> [Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs]</span> and documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6(4) - SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINS</strong> <p><p>The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6(5) - PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS</strong> <p><p>The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to <span class="option" id="AC-6(5)_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]</span>.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6(6) - PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS</strong> <p><p>The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by non-organizational users.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6(7) - REVIEW OF USER PRIVILEGES</strong> <p><p>The organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>AC-6(7)(a)</strong> Reviews <span class="option" id="AC-6(7)(a)_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]</span> the privileges assigned to <span class="option" id="AC-6(7)(a)_Option2"> [Assignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users]</span> to validate the need for such privileges; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>AC-6(7)(b)</strong> Reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission/business needs.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6(8) - PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR CODE EXECUTION</strong> <p><p>The information system prevents <span class="option" id="AC-6(8)_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined software]</span> from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6(9) - AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS</strong> <p><p>The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-6(10) - PROHIBIT NON-PRIVILEGED USERS FROM EXECUTING PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS</strong> <p><p>The information system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.</p>
