                <p>The information system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SC-42a.</strong> Prohibits the remote activation of environmental sensing capabilities with the following exceptions: <span class="option" id="SC-42a_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined exceptions where remote activation of sensors is allowed]</span>; and

<li>
<strong>SC-42b.</strong> Provides an explicit indication of sensor use to <span class="option" id="SC-42b_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined class of users]</span>.

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>This control often applies to types of information systems or system components characterized as mobile devices, for example, smart phones, tablets, and E-readers. These systems often include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment where the system is in use. Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include, for example, cameras, microphones, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While the sensors on mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly, such devices can potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about individuals and organizations. For example, remotely activating the GPS function on a mobile device could provide an adversary with the ability to track the specific movements of an individual.</p>
