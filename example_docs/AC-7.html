                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The information system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>AC-7a.</strong> Enforces a limit of <span class="option" id="AC-7a_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined number]</span> consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a <span class="option" id="AC-7a_Option2"> [Assignment: organization-defined time period]</span>; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>AC-7b.</strong> Automatically <span class="option" id="AC-7b_Option1"> [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined time period]</span>; locks the account/node until released by an administrator; delays next logon prompt according to <span class="option" id="AC-7b_Option2"> [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]</span>] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
</li>
</ol>

        <div class="section" id="guidance">
            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by information systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time period established by organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose to employ different algorithms for different information system components based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at both the operating system and the application levels.</p>
