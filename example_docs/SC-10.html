                <p>The information system terminates the network connection associated with a communications session at the end of the session or after <span class="option" id="SC-10_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined time period]</span> of inactivity.</p>

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>This control applies to both internal and external networks. Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions include, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network connection. Time periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and include, for example, time periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.</p>
