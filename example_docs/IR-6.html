                <p>The organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>IR-6a.</strong> Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability within <span class="option" id="IR-6a_Option1"> 24 hours if not otherwise defined in formal organizational policy</span>; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>IR-6b.</strong> Reports security incident information to <span class="option" id="IR-6b_Option1"> the appropriate SAP Agency CIRT/CERT (see IR-4(8))</span>.
</li>
</ol>

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for federal agencies and their subordinate organizations. Suspected security incidents include, for example, the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Current federal policy requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted from such requirements) report security incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of Operations for Federal Cyber Security Incident Handling.</p>

            <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IR-6(1) - AUTOMATED REPORTING</strong> <p><p>The organization employs automated mechanisms to assist in the reporting of security incidents.</p>
</p><div class="enhancement_additional_context" <p>
    Differing types of automated mechanisms can meet the intent of IR-6(1) This mechanism
may be a web-based form that is populated by the ISSM/ISSO or SA alerting the
appropriate individuals, or an email process that includes a preset distribution group to
ensure all key individuals are alerted in the event of an incident, e.g., ISSM/ISSO,
GSSO/CPSO, PSO/Director of Security, Incident Response lead (e.g., SAPCO’s IA
POC), DAO, and AO. Where a web-based form or email distribution is used, the
responder should be cautious of the type of incident and the classification of information
in the incident description and the classification of the system being used.
</p></div></li> <li><strong>IR-6(2) - VULNERABILITIES RELATED TO INCIDENTS</strong> <p><p>The organization reports information system vulnerabilities associated with reported security incidents to <span class="option" id="IR-6(2)_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]</span>.</p>
</p><div class="enhancement_additional_context" <p>
    Service/Agency SAPCOs should identify an entity to provide Computer Network
Defense (CND). PSOs and field reps would then report all incidents to the CND Service
Provider (CNDSP) for analysis and response determination, providing guidance to the
site as needed. This provides an organization-wide awareness of incidents, a broader
capability for identifying trends, and the potential to share information with other
organizations in the community.
</p></div></li> <li><strong>IR-6(3) - COORDINATION WITH SUPPLY CHAIN</strong> <p><p>The organization provides security incident information to other organizations involved in the supply chain for information systems or information system components related to the incident.</p>

            <h2>Baselines</h2>
            <p>LOW, MODERATE, HIGH</p>

            <h2>Additional Context</h2>
            <p>
    In the case of a suspected incident, containment procedures must begin immediately.
However, PSO/GSSO/CPSO confirmation of the classification of the information spilled is
required promptly so decisions concerning scale of containment and eradication efforts can
be scoped, e.g., SAP data spilled onto another SAP system tends to be (although not always)
less critical than SAP data spilled to an unclassified system.
</p>
<p>
    The ISSM/ISSO is responsible for reporting incidents to security as well as to the AO, e.g.,
the ISSM/ISSO reports to the GSSO/CPSO, who in turn reports to the PSO and the PSO to
the Director of Security and/or CA SAPCO. The ISSM/ISSO must also report the incident to
the system DAO who in turn reports it to the AO and/or CA SAPCO. [IR-6.b] If an activity
from another organization is involved, the PSO or Director of Security will provide proper
notification to the organization.
</p>
<p>
    Incidents in progress are classified a minimum of UNCLASSIFIED//Handle via Special
Access Channels Only (U//HVSACO). The PSO should be notified via secure
communications as soon as an incident has occurred or is in progress. Initial/interim
reporting should begin as soon as possible after knowledge of the incident and should
continue until the incident is resolved.
</p>
<p>
    Organizations will continue to report until the incident is closed. The CA SAPCO, Director
of Security, and AO will determine follow-on actions.
</p>
<p>
    Information system-related fraud, waste, and abuse issues should be reported to the PSO,
ISO and/or ISSM/ISSO and dealt with by the organization’s chain of command. Individuals
also have the right to call the Fraud, Waste and Abuse Center (FWAC) hotline.
