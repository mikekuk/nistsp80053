                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SA-22a.</strong> Replaces information system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-22b.</strong> Provides justification and documents approval for the continued use of unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business needs.

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>Support for information system components includes, for example, software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. Unsupported components (e.g., when vendors are no longer providing critical software patches), provide a substantial opportunity for adversaries to exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components may include, for example, systems that provide critical mission/business capability where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.</p>
