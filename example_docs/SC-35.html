                <p>The information system includes components that proactively seek to identify malicious websites and/or web-based malicious code.</p>

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>Honeyclients differ from honeypots in that the components actively probe the Internet in search of malicious code (e.g., worms) contained on external websites. As with honeypots, honeyclients require some supporting isolation measures (e.g., virtualization) to ensure that any malicious code discovered during the search and subsequently executed does not infect organizational information systems.</p>
