                <p>The organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>RA-5a.</strong> Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications <span class="option" id="RA-5a_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process]</span> and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5b.</strong> Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
<ol>
<li>
<strong>RA-5b.1.</strong> Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5b.2.</strong> Formatting checklists and test procedures; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5b.3.</strong> Measuring vulnerability impact;
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5c.</strong> Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5d.</strong> Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities <span class="option" id="RA-5d_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined response times]</span> in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5e.</strong> Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with <span class="option" id="RA-5e_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]</span> to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
</li>
