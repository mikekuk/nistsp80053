                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>RA-5a.</strong> Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5b.</strong> Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
<ol>
<li>
<strong>RA-5b.1.</strong> Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5b.2.</strong> Formatting checklists and test procedures; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5b.3.</strong> Measuring vulnerability impact;
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5c.</strong> Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5d.</strong> Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>RA-5e.</strong> Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
</li>
</ol>

                <li><strong>RA-5 (1) - UPDATE TOOL CAPABILITY</strong> <p><p>The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update the information system vulnerabilities to be scanned.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>RA-5 (2) - UPDATE BY FREQUENCY / PRIOR TO NEW SCAN / WHEN IDENTIFIED</strong> <p><p>The organization updates the information system vulnerabilities scanned [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; prior to a new scan; when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>RA-5 (3) - BREADTH / DEPTH OF COVERAGE</strong> <p><p>The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can identify the breadth and depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned and vulnerabilities checked).</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>RA-5 (4) - DISCOVERABLE INFORMATION</strong> <p><p>The organization determines what information about the information system is discoverable by adversaries and subsequently takes [Assignment: organization-defined corrective actions].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>RA-5 (5) - PRIVILEGED ACCESS</strong> <p><p>The information system implements privileged access authorization to [Assignment: organization-identified information system components] for selected [Assignment: organization-defined vulnerability scanning activities].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>RA-5 (6) - AUTOMATED TREND ANALYSES</strong> <p><p>The organization employs automated mechanisms to compare the results of vulnerability scans over time to determine trends in information system vulnerabilities.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>RA-5 (7) - AUTOMATED DETECTION AND NOTIFICATION OF UNAUTHORIZED COMPONENTS</strong> <p><p>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-8].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>RA-5 (8) - REVIEW HISTORIC AUDIT LOGS</strong> <p><p>The organization reviews historic audit logs to determine if a vulnerability identified in the information system has been previously exploited.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>RA-5 (9) - PENETRATION TESTING AND ANALYSES</strong> <p><p>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CA-8].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>RA-5 (10) - CORRELATE SCANNING INFORMATION</strong> <p><p>The organization correlates the output from vulnerability scanning tools to determine the presence of multi-vulnerability/multi-hop attack vectors.</p>
