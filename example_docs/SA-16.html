                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to provide <span class="option" id="SA-16_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined training]</span> on the correct use and operation of the implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms.</p>

        <div class="section" id="guidance">
            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>This control applies to external and internal (in-house) developers. Training of personnel is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security controls implemented within organizational information systems. Training options include, for example, classroom-style training, web-based/computer-based training, and hands-on training. Organizations can also request sufficient training materials from developers to conduct in-house training or offer self-training to organizational personnel. Organizations determine the type of training necessary and may require different types of training for different security functions, controls, or mechanisms.</p>
