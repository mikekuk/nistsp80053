                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SI-13a.</strong> Determines mean time to failure (MTTF) for [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] in specific environments of operation; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>SI-13b.</strong> Provides substitute information system components and a means to exchange active and standby components at [Assignment: organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria].
</li>
</ol>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>SI-13 (1) - TRANSFERRING COMPONENT RESPONSIBILITIES</strong> <p><p>The organization takes information system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than [Assignment: organization-defined fraction or percentage] of mean time to failure.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>SI-13 (2) - TIME LIMIT ON PROCESS EXECUTION WITHOUT SUPERVISION</strong> <p><p>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-7 (16)].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>SI-13 (3) - MANUAL TRANSFER BETWEEN COMPONENTS</strong> <p><p>The organization manually initiates transfers between active and standby information system components [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] if the mean time to failure exceeds [Assignment: organization-defined time period].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>SI-13 (4) - STANDBY COMPONENT INSTALLATION / NOTIFICATION</strong> <p><p>The organization, if information system component failures are detected:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SI-13 (4)(a)</strong> Ensures that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>SI-13 (4)(b)</strong> [Selection (one or more): activates [Assignment: organization-defined alarm]; automatically shuts down the information system].
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>SI-13 (5) - FAILOVER CAPABILITY</strong> <p><p>The organization provides [Selection: real-time; near real-time] [Assignment: organization-defined failover capability] for the information system.</p>
</p></li>
