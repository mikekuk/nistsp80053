                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].</p>

            <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AC-4 (1) - OBJECT SECURITY ATTRIBUTES</strong> <p><p>The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] associated with [Assignment: organization-defined information, source, and destination objects] to enforce [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (2) - PROCESSING DOMAINS</strong> <p><p>The information system uses protected processing domains to enforce [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (3) - DYNAMIC INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL</strong> <p><p>The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on [Assignment: organization-defined policies].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (4) - CONTENT CHECK ENCRYPTED INFORMATION</strong> <p><p>The information system prevents encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by [Selection (one or more): decrypting the information; blocking the flow of the encrypted information; terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted information; [Assignment: organization-defined procedure or method]].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (5) - EMBEDDED DATA TYPES</strong> <p><p>The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined limitations] on embedding data types within other data types.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (6) - METADATA</strong> <p><p>The information system enforces information flow control based on [Assignment: organization-defined metadata].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (7) - ONE-WAY FLOW MECHANISMS</strong> <p><p>The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined one-way information flows] using hardware mechanisms.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (8) - SECURITY POLICY FILTERS</strong> <p><p>The information system enforces information flow control using [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] as a basis for flow control decisions for [Assignment: organization-defined information flows].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (9) - HUMAN REVIEWS</strong> <p><p>The information system enforces the use of human reviews for [Assignment: organization-defined information flows] under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (10) - ENABLE / DISABLE SECURITY POLICY FILTERS</strong> <p><p>The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to enable/disable [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (11) - CONFIGURATION OF SECURITY POLICY FILTERS</strong> <p><p>The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to configure [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] to support different security policies.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (12) - DATA TYPE IDENTIFIERS</strong> <p><p>The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, uses [Assignment: organization-defined data type identifiers] to validate data essential for information flow decisions.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (13) - DECOMPOSITION INTO POLICY-RELEVANT SUBCOMPONENTS</strong> <p><p>The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, decomposes information into [Assignment: organization-defined policy-relevant subcomponents] for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (14) - SECURITY POLICY FILTER CONSTRAINTS</strong> <p><p>The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, implements [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] requiring fully enumerated formats that restrict data structure and content.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (15) - DETECTION OF UNSANCTIONED INFORMATION</strong> <p><p>The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, examines the information for the presence of [Assignment: organized-defined unsanctioned information] and prohibits the transfer of such information in accordance with the [Assignment: organization-defined security policy].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (16) - INFORMATION TRANSFERS ON INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS</strong> <p><p>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-4].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (17) - DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION</strong> <p><p>The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination points by [Selection (one or more): organization, system, application, individual] for information transfer.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (18) - SECURITY ATTRIBUTE BINDING</strong> <p><p>The information system binds security attributes to information using [Assignment: organization-defined binding techniques] to facilitate information flow policy enforcement.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (19) - VALIDATION OF METADATA</strong> <p><p>The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, applies the same security policy filtering to metadata as it applies to data payloads.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (20) - APPROVED SOLUTIONS</strong> <p><p>The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined solutions in approved configurations] to control the flow of [Assignment: organization-defined information] across security domains.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (21) - PHYSICAL / LOGICAL SEPARATION OF INFORMATION FLOWS</strong> <p><p>The information system separates information flows logically or physically using [Assignment: organization-defined mechanisms and/or techniques] to accomplish [Assignment: organization-defined required separations by types of information].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>AC-4 (22) - ACCESS ONLY</strong> <p><p>The information system provides access from a single device to computing platforms, applications, or data residing on multiple different security domains, while preventing any information flow between the different security domains.</p>
