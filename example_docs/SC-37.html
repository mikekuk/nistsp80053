                <p>The organization employs <span class="option" id="SC-37_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band channels]</span> for the physical delivery or electronic transmission of <span class="option" id="SC-37_Option2"> [Assignment: organization-defined information, information system components, or devices]</span> to <span class="option" id="SC-37_Option3"> [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or information systems]</span>.</p>

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>Out-of-band channels include, for example, local (nonnetwork) accesses to information systems, network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational traffic, or nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal Service. This is in contrast with using the same channels (i.e., in-band channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels do not have the same vulnerability/exposure as in-band channels, and hence the confidentiality, integrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise the out-of-band channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of many organizational items including, for example, identifiers/authenticators, configuration management changes for hardware, firmware, or software, cryptographic key management information, security updates, system/data backups, maintenance information, and malicious code protection updates.</p>
