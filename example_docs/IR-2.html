<li>
<strong>IR-2a.</strong> Within <span class="option" id="IR-2a_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined time period]</span> of assuming an incident response role or responsibility;

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>Incident response training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the information system; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle/remediate incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification and reporting of suspicious activities, both from external and internal sources.</p>

    Emphasis is on simulated, e.g., table top exercises, hot-wash, lessons learned. Use of
'live' data (e.g., 'controlled viruses') must have prior approval by the AO.

            <h2>Additional Context</h2>
            <p>
    Incident recognition and reporting training shall be included as part of both general and
privileged user awareness training. See also Security Training [AT-3].
</p>
<p>
    General users must be trained on what constitutes suspicious activity as it applies to the
system, other users, and unauthorized individuals internal and external to the organization.
General users must also know to whom and when to report suspicious activity and to keep
discussions about potential incidents within the incident response chain of command.
</p>
<p>
    Privileged users should be trained in preserving the scene, preserving the data (volatile and
nonvolatile), chain of custody, and reporting requirements. Privileged users frequently move
from the containment phase to eradication compromising data necessary in prosecuting a
potentially criminal case. Privileged users must also know who to contact for assistance in
responding to an incident, e.g., the organizations IA point of contact. Additional incident
response related training may be required depending on the system, environment, and
mission criticality.
