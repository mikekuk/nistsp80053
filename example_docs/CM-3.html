                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>CM-3a.</strong> Determines the types of changes to the information system that are configuration-controlled;
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3b.</strong> Reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security impact analyses;
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3c.</strong> Documents configuration change decisions associated with the information system;
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3d.</strong> Implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information system;
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3e.</strong> Retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system for [Assignment: organization-defined time period];
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3f.</strong> Audits and reviews activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the information system; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3g.</strong> Coordinates and provides oversight for configuration change control activities through [Assignment: organization-defined configuration change control element (e.g., committee, board)] that convenes [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; [Assignment: organization-defined configuration change conditions]].

                <li><strong>CM-3 (1) - AUTOMATED DOCUMENT / NOTIFICATION / PROHIBITION OF CHANGES</strong> <p><p>The organization employs automated mechanisms to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>CM-3 (1)(a)</strong> Document proposed changes to the information system;
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3 (1)(b)</strong> Notify [Assignment: organized-defined approval authorities] of proposed changes to the information system and request change approval;
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3 (1)(c)</strong> Highlight proposed changes to the information system that have not been approved or disapproved by [Assignment: organization-defined time period];
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3 (1)(d)</strong> Prohibit changes to the information system until designated approvals are received;
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3 (1)(e)</strong> Document all changes to the information system; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>CM-3 (1)(f)</strong> Notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel] when approved changes to the information system are completed.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>CM-3 (2) - TEST / VALIDATE / DOCUMENT CHANGES</strong> <p><p>The organization tests, validates, and documents changes to the information system before implementing the changes on the operational system.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>CM-3 (3) - AUTOMATED CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION</strong> <p><p>The organization employs automated mechanisms to implement changes to the current information system baseline and deploys the updated baseline across the installed base.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>CM-3 (4) - SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</strong> <p><p>The organization requires an information security representative to be a member of the [Assignment: organization-defined configuration change control element].</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>CM-3 (5) - AUTOMATED SECURITY RESPONSE</strong> <p><p>The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security responses] automatically if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>CM-3 (6) - CRYPTOGRAPHY MANAGEMENT</strong> <p><p>The organization ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are under configuration management.</p>
