                <p>The organization establishes and manages cryptographic keys for required cryptography employed within the information system in accordance with <span class="option" id="SC-12_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined requirements for key generation, distribution, storage, access, and destruction]</span>.</p>

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. Organizations define key management requirements in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance, specifying appropriate options, levels, and parameters. Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust anchors are in such trust stores. This includes certificates with visibility external to organizational information systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems.</p>
