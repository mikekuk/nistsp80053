                <p>The information system requests and performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.</p>

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on its own, or has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers. Information systems that provide name and address resolution services for local clients include, for example, recursive resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) servers. DNS client resolvers either perform validation of DNSSEC signatures, or clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that perform such validations. Information systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map between host/service names and network addresses provide other means to enable clients to verify the authenticity and integrity of response data.</p>
