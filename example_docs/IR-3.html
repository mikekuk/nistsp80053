            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the overall effectiveness of the capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes, for example, the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel/full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals due to incident response.</p>

            <p>
    Lessons learned should be documented and incorporated into future exercises. If there were
no incidents during the past year, the incident response plan shall be tested using a simulated
incident/event.
