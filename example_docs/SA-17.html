                <h2>Control Description</h2>
                <p>The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SA-17a.</strong> Is consistent with and supportive of the organization's security architecture which is established within and is an integrated part of the organization's enterprise architecture;
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17b.</strong> Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of security controls among physical and logical components; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17c.</strong> Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.
</li>

                <li><strong>SA-17(1) - FORMAL POLICY MODEL</strong> <p><p>The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(1)(a)</strong> Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal policy model describing the <span class="option" id="SA-17(1)(a)_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined elements of organizational security policy]</span> to be enforced; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(1)(b)</strong> Prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the defined elements of the organizational security policy when implemented.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>SA-17(2) - SECURITY-RELEVANT COMPONENTS</strong> <p><p>The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(2)(a)</strong> Define security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(2)(b)</strong> Provide a rationale that the definition for security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware is complete.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>SA-17(3) - FORMAL CORRESPONDENCE</strong> <p><p>The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(3)(a)</strong> Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(3)(b)</strong> Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary, that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(3)(c)</strong> Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(3)(d)</strong> Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(3)(e)</strong> Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the formal top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>SA-17(4) - INFORMAL CORRESPONDENCE</strong> <p><p>The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(4)(a)</strong> Produce, as an integral part of the development process, an informal descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(4)(b)</strong> Show via <span class="option" id="SA-17(4)(b)_Option1"> [Selection: informal demonstration, convincing argument with formal methods as feasible]</span> that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(4)(c)</strong> Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification completely  covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(4)(d)</strong> Show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(4)(e)</strong> Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the descriptive top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>SA-17(5) - CONCEPTUALLY SIMPLE DESIGN</strong> <p><p>The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(5)(a)</strong> Design and structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to use a complete, conceptually simple protection mechanism with precisely defined semantics; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>SA-17(5)(b)</strong> Internally structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware with specific regard for this mechanism.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li> <li><strong>SA-17(6) - STRUCTURE FOR TESTING</strong> <p><p>The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to structure security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to facilitate testing.</p>
</p></li> <li><strong>SA-17(7) - STRUCTURE FOR LEAST PRIVILEGE</strong> <p><p>The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to structure security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to facilitate controlling access with least privilege.</p>
