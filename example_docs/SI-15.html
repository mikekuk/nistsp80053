                <p>The information system validates information output from <span class="option" id="SI-15_Option1"> [Assignment: organization-defined software programs and/or applications]</span> to ensure that the information is consistent with the expected content.</p>

            <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
            <p>Certain types of cyber attacks (e.g., SQL injections) produce output results that are unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would normally be expected from software programs or applications. This control enhancement focuses on detecting extraneous content, preventing such extraneous content from being displayed, and alerting monitoring tools that anomalous behavior has been discovered.</p>
