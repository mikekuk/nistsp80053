# NIST SP800-53 Control Library

This library provides a structured representation of the NIST Special Publication 800-53 controls. It enables parsing, manipulation, and formatted output of controls as defined in SP800-53 Revision 4 and Revision 5 XML files. The library is designed to help organizations handle, customize, and export NIST controls and their associated metadata in both plain text and Markdown formats.

## Overview

The library is organized into classes that parse and manage NIST control data, baselines, and control enhancements, supporting the creation of custom control sets based on organization-specific requirements.

## Features

- Parse XML representations of NIST SP800-53 control sets.
- Define custom baselines by selecting specific controls.
- Apply user-defined variable options to customize control fields.
- Format controls as plain text or Markdown.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- XML files for SP800-53 Revision 4 or Revision 5 controls (`etc/800-53-rev4-controls.xml` and `etc/SP_800-53_v5_1_XML.xml`)

## Usage

### Initializing Control Libraries

The library supports both Revision 4 and Revision 5 control sets. Initialize by creating an instance of `Nist_sp_800_53_r4` or `Nist_sp_800_53_r5`, depending on the desired revision.

```python
from your_module import Nist_sp_800_53_r4, Nist_sp_800_53_r5

# For Revision 4 controls
control_set_r4 = Nist_sp_800_53_r4()

# For Revision 5 controls
control_set_r5 = Nist_sp_800_53_r5()
```

### Accessing Controls

Controls are parsed and stored as instances of `Nist_sp_800_53_control`, and each control's information can be printed or accessed programmatically.

```python
# Print control details
print(control_set_r4.controls['AC-1'])
```

### Formatting Controls

Controls can be output in plain text or Markdown formats for easy documentation.

```python
# Get control text
text_output = control_set_r4.controls['AC-1'].get_control_text()

# Get control markdown
markdown_output = control_set_r4.controls['AC-1'].get_control_markdown()
```

### Control Enhancements

Control enhancements provide additional requirements that augment the main control. Each enhancement is parsed and stored in a dictionary within the control object, accessible through the `control_enhancements` attribute. Enhancements can be further customized, formatted, and applied to the main control as part of the baseline.

```python
# Access control enhancements for a specific control
enhancements = control_set_r4.controls['AC-1'].control_enhancements
print(enhancements)
```

### User-Defined Variables (Options)

Some controls include user-defined variables that can be set to tailor the control to organizational needs. These variables, referred to as "options" in the code, allow users to specify values that reflect the controlâ€™s application within the organization. Options are set and accessed using the `set_option` method in the control class. 

To view available options, use the `control.options` attribute:

```python
# View available options for a control
control = control_set_r4.controls['AC-1']
print(control.options)

# Set a user-defined variable for a control
control.set_option('option_id', 'Custom Value')
```

### Working with Baselines

Create a custom baseline by defining a set of controls and applying it to a control library instance.

```python
from your_module import Baseline

# Define a baseline with specific controls
custom_baseline = Baseline(controls={'AC-1': {}, 'AC-2': {}}, name="Custom Baseline", revision=4)
control_set_r4.load_baseline(custom_baseline)
```

### Predefined Baselines

The `baselines` directory contains predefined baseline objects for both SP800-53 Revision 4 and Revision 5, with varying impact levels:

- **Revision 4**: `Privacy`, `Low`, `Moderate`, `High`
- **Revision 5**: `Privacy`, `Low`, `Moderate`, `High`

These baseline objects can be directly imported and applied to control libraries for convenience.

## Classes

### `Control`

Base class for all control types. Currently a placeholder for future shared functionality among control classes.

### `Baseline`

Defines a control baseline with a specified set of controls and metadata. Used to filter controls in a library based on the baseline's requirements.

### `Library`

Base class for the control library, initializing with an empty control set. Extended by the NIST control classes.

### `Nist_sp_800_53_control`

Represents an individual control, with fields parsed from the XML representation. Provides methods to set custom options, output control data in text or Markdown, and track control enhancements.

### `Nist_sp800_53`

Parent class for all NIST SP800-53 libraries, handling XML parsing, control loading, and baseline filtering.

### `Nist_sp_800_53_r4` and `Nist_sp_800_53_r5`

Subclasses of `Nist_sp800_53` tailored to Revision 4 and Revision 5 of the SP800-53 standard, respectively. Each initializes with the appropriate XML data path.

## Example

```python
# Initialize the library
nist_controls = Nist_sp_800_53_r5()

# Print control details in Markdown
print(nist_controls.controls['AC-1'].get_control_markdown())

# Load a baseline
baseline = Baseline(controls={'AC-1': {}, 'AC-2': {}}, name="Minimal Baseline", revision=5)
nist_controls.load_baseline(baseline)
```
